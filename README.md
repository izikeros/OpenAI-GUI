# OpenAI-GUI

This is a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with various OpenAI models. With this GUI, you can easily run various language and machine learning models, such as GPT-3 and DALL-E, without needing to use the command line.

The program works. If you encounter problems running it or have other bug reports or features that you wish to see implemented, please fork the project and submit a pull request and/or file an [issue](https://github.com/MaxSSD/OpenAI-GUI/issues) on this project.

# TBD
1. Add Whisper.
2. Button binds for functionality (Enter, Esc, Delete)
4. Write to class

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
In order to use this GUI, you will need to have a valid OpenAI API key. You can sign up for a free API key at the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).

You will also need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

# Installation
To install the GUI, first clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/MaxSSD/OpenAI-GUI.git
```
Next, navigate to the root directory of the project and install the required dependencies:
```
cd OpenAI-GUI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage
To run the GUI, simply enter the following command:
```
python openaigui.py
```
The GUI will then open in a new window. You can select the desired OpenAI model from the dropdown menu and enter your input in the text box. When you are ready, click the "Run" button to send your input to the model and view the results.

# Troubleshooting
On macOS when experiencing the problem with importing the `tkinter` module, try installing the `python-tk` package with Homebrew:
```shell
brew install python-tk
```
